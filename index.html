        <p>Located in the town of Rajgir, in the northern Indian state of Bihar, Nalanda University is a postgraduate, research-intensive, international university supported by the participating countries of the East Asia Summit. It was established by an Act of the Indian Parliament in 2010.
            The university was set up to emulate the ancient university of Nalanda, which functioned between the 5th and 13th centuries. The ancient Nalanda was a revered Buddhist monastery and a renowned centre of learning in the ancient kingdom of Magadha.
            The President of India serves as Visitor to the university. The university began its first academic session on 1 September 2014 with 15 students in the School of Historical Studies and the School of Ecology and Environmental studies.
            The university has been envisioned as an international institution of national importance and excellence. It is designated as an Institute of National Importance (INI).
            The campus spans over 160 hectares (400 acres) and is under construction with over 80 percent having been completed by 2021. The university started functioning from its 455-acres new campus from January 2020.</p>
